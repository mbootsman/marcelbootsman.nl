Hi! My name is Marcel Bootsman. This is my personal site on which I share some of my thoughts and experiences about my work, private life and everything in between. There will also be technical content about Open Source, Web development, WordPress and Hugo (which this is generated with since October, 2022).

## Professional biography ##
My current role, since April 2019, is Marketing Manager Dutch Market for [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/). 

The journey of my professional life started in 2000, when I worked for IBM and was involved in developing a web version of a legacy terminal-based equipment ordering system. After about 9 years, and a diverse number of roles within IBM, the challenge of running my own company became so strong that i could not ignore it anymore. 

In 2009 I started [nostromo.nl](https://nostromo.nl/). I started building webistes with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and became familiar with developing themes and custom plugins. Within a year of running my own company, I joined the WordPress community by volunteering. Organizing WordCamps (WordPress centric events) and helping out with translations in Dutch were, and are still, some tasks I really like to do.

Again after about 10 years (do you see the trend here?) I got to think about the status of my company during a [walk from my hometown to Berlin for WordCamp Europe 2019](https://walktowc.eu/). Soon after that event, I made the decision to stop my work at nostromo.nl, and work for Kinsta.
