Dear WordCamp Europe organisation,

After registering as a volunteer for [WordCamp Europe](http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/), I received a call from [Remkus](https://remkusdevries.com/) yesterday. I was asked if I was interested in being the Manager for the volunteers. I feel honored to be asked for this role, but I had to consult this with my wife first.

The reasons for the consult are:

1. My wife is pregnant are we are due to have brother or sister for Noam on the 15th of september. Since it is a due date, the latest day of giving birth would be september 30th. This is very close to [\#wceu](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wceu). And as a fresh father for the second time, I might be needed at home.
2. Our son, Noam, has his birthday on October 4th. He will be two this year, and he might have his party in the [\#wceu](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wceu) weekend.

These two reasons might cause that I am not available for one of the three [\#wceu](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wceu) days which is not acceptable for a role this important. After consulting with my wife, we have come to the following: (this is not going to be a surprise if you paid attention to the site title ðŸ˜‰ )

1. Having a second baby is as exciting as having the first. There is of course some uncertainty about the date of birth and the gender (we love surprises) and there might be an aftermath for my wife, in which she is in need of care, by me, our parents or medical professionals. Having consulted with my wife, we agreed that is it possible for me to leave our expanded family for three days, of course with the exception of an emergency.
2. Having a birthday party while just having received a fresh brother or sister is not going to happen. This is too much, since mum needs rest. So, no birthday party in the [\#wceu](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wceu) weekend, and dad can support the WordPress community in Leiden.

Thatâ€™s it.

Iâ€™m looking forward in getting to know a lot of people, meet people I only know as an avatar and having the responsibility to guide all the volunteers on [WordCam](http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/)[p Europe](http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/) so that the event will be awesome for all, speakers, attendees and volunteers.
