After almost 11 years working for a diverse range of clients, I have decided to start a new adventure. Starting April 1st, I’ll be working full-time for [Kinsta – Managed WordPress Hosting](https://kinsta.com/nl/), as Marketing Manager Dutch Market.

Why did I take this step?
-------------------------

In 2009 I decided I wanted to serve my own clients and left my employer to start [nostromo.nl](https://nostromo.nl). Since then I have served many clients and helped them improve their publishing workflow, developed new websites and grew their revenue. And now, I’m ending that.

I’m ending this because I feel like I’m loosing enthusiasm. As I have learned from the past, when I loose enthusiasm for my job, I’m going to postpone or even prevent certain tasks. And that will definitely not help my clients. They deserve the attention and enthusiasm they are used from me, nothing less. Also, I have been looking to get employed WordPress related companies, just talks, but the option of me working for another company than my own crossed my mind. That was a confirmation of my declining enthusiasm to run my own company and serve my clients.

Another option I had thought about was scaling my company. I have been working with numerous partners to deliver what clients wanted. Sometimes my own two hands just could not complete the task because of lack of time, technical challenges, or without me knowing enough about it the task. Hiring people/companies on a project basis to get more skills in certain areas worked great but just did’nt work out all the time. Sometimes (to be honest, most of the times) partners had no time because they were already involved in other projects. When that happens, I cannot close a deal with a client, because I simply can’t handle the extra workload.

And then, the final option I have thought about, hiring people. So nostromo.nl would not be a one man company anymore. Most of the times I have thought about this it only lasted a few minutes, then I stopped considering this to be an option. Mainly because I really like the flexibility of hiring partners on a project basis and do not like to have fixed employees.

So, all options I thought about did not spark my enthusiasm in a way that I wanted to seriously pursue them. Except one. The only option that gave me positive vibes, was working for an employer, or as a contractor.

Let’s go back to May 2019. I was walking to Berlin to raise funds for DonateWC, and I named it [Walk To WordCamp Europe](https://www.walktowc.eu/). Do you see who was the Golden Shoe sponsor (or in normal English, the main sponsor)? Yes, Kinsta. For many reasons the conversations before the adventure, and on WordCamps where Kinsta was sponsor, really gave me a good feeling about them and their services.

So, in December 2019 I decided to contact Kinsta to explore the possibility of me working for them. Well, the result of that is now known. I’m very happy that Kinsta allows me to start this new adventure and I’m looking forward to start the new job.

About Kinsta
------------

Kinsta was founded in 2013 and their goal is to be the best WordPress hosting platform in the world. Their team is remote-first with local hubs.

Performance is Kinsta’s obsession and by fine-tuning their servers they deliver maximum speeds. Only the best technology is used at Kinsta, from their server hardware to the software they run. No matter what development stack you use, they will always have the latest framework versions installed and up to date. Servers are powered by the Google Cloud Platform in 22 global data centers. Everything is interconnected over their premium tier network, designed to minimize distance and hops, resulting in fast and secure transport of your data.

These and much more features give customers an automatic scalable (when traffic spikes), easy manageable (with [MyKinsta](https://kinsta.com/mykinsta/)) and isolated (no performance impact of other sites hosted at Kinsta) WordPress hosting environment.

What about nostromo.nl?
-----------------------

Since I’ll be going to work for Kinsta on a full time basis, I have no room in my schedule to deliver the same amount of service to my clients. As of March 1st, clients with a WordPress maintenance contract have been transferred to [Buro Staal](https://burostaal.nl).

Projects that are in progress will be finished as agreed upon and I will not accept any new projects. So basically, all services delivered from nostromo.nl will be stopped.

I want to thank all my clients for choosing me and nostromo.nl for their WordPress related challenges. (Of course I have already informed and thanked all my clients of this career move).
